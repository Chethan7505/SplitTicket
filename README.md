# 🚆 SplitTicket — Smart Train Seat Optimization

**Concept Project Prototype**

SplitTicket is a smart ticket booking concept that suggests **split-ticket routes** to improve **seat utilization** on Indian Railways.  
It analyzes train schedules and seat availability to help passengers find **best possible combinations** for booking tickets across intermediate stops.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To build a **research-based prototype** that demonstrates how AI and data-driven logic could enhance ticket availability without increasing train capacity.

---

## 🧩 Features (Prototype)
- Suggests **split-ticket combinations** for long routes.
- Uses **basic data simulation** (train segments & seat availability).
- Built with **Python + Streamlit** for quick visualization.
- Conceptual focus on **optimization**, not actual live data.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Frontend/UI:** Streamlit  
- **Backend Logic:** Python  
- **IDE:** VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub
